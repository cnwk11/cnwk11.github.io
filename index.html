		<h1>CSS Selectors and Properties</h1>
		<p>In HTML, we call them tags. In CSS, they're called selectors. Why? Because in CSS, you can apply styles to many, many more things than just tags. The term selector is just a bit more accurate.</p>
		<p>Styles can be added as an attribute directly inside a tag, but that method is a little clumsy and not very efficient if you want to apply the same style to many tags in a page.</p>
		<p>The other place to set the styles is in the place where all of the "behind the scenes" action takes place in the html file: in the <strong>head.</strong></p>
		<p>How do you define a style in the head? By adding tags, of course! All styles can be placed in the head between an opening and closing "style" tag. </p>
